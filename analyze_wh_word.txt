, which // it helped with the shame and self-loathing , which made it quite worthwhile , but i think depression and anxiety are often organic

, which // of course not , i think they elected them in the hopes that they would stand for the values that they claimed they stood for , which apparently takes priority over making a president look bad for things he is not responsible for ( instead of pointing out the real bullshit he does , like defending the nsa , betraying his promise to deal with guantanamo , or appointing wheeler fo the fcc

, which // amp ; nbsp ; if you 're the former then i highly suggest you 're trying to make a new account where you 'd purposely lose every single game , which will land you on a hellish pub level and experience the moment where you `` ca n't rely on your teammates '' in a solo queue matchmaking

, which // i would also agree that there is a lack of detail , which really tones down the suspense and fear that i would feel from a truly horrific scene

, which // it seems to flow a lot faster now , which is great

, which // they sure do , which is why i specified the movies

, which // but instead , they just roll along with the shitty system they have , which punishes more innocent people than legitimate griefers

, which // on top of better police forces and a larger population , you have gangs , which makes invading/taking nearly impossible

, which // the thing about dark net market is that most vendors base their prices on us dollars , which sucks for me because canadian dollars went down a lot recently

, which // i think what gets me about this rock , is that it looks ( obviously i can only see the foliation plane and not the full 3d structure ) like it is more l-tectonite than s-tectonite , which makes me want to not call it a gneiss or a schist and assign it a more genetic term like an amphibolite facies ( i 'm guessing here ) l-s tectonite

, which // he 's been and continues to be an excellent manager who is not at fault for any of the real problems city have faced this season , which include the injury problems , the yaya off-season drama which led to his slow start , the completely mish-mashed pre-season due to the world cup and then the lack of fitness of those players when the season began

, which // on the other hand , anger seems to be encouraged , which is disheartening

, which // girls expect guys to not act like that because it 's seen as sleazy , which to a degree is understandable

, which // this is seen as sexist towards women/homophobic ( and rightly so—it is ) , but nobody cares that they 're being told that they 're not `` manly '' enough , which is an issue i think we 'll have to deal with in the near future

, which // gt ; snip snip & gt ; reversible unless you were referring to the drug , and if i remember properly , that involved injecting female hormones , which 'd definitely need reccomendations , etc

, which // here is an important series of events worth considering though : - europe in the 1500 's had no access to the silk road , which connected the very wealthy nations of asia , the middle east , and africa and excluded an impoverished europe

, which // centuries of imperialism and colonialism follow , which went very very poorly for every country that was n't europe , and the effects of which are still noticeable today

, which // valve servers that connect to the game/vpn as a spectators , which is the server people `` in game '' with tickets view the match on local `` streaming computers '' connect to the game/vpn as spectators for twitch streams ( edit : or any other streaming site ... ) this way , unless the vpn or the valve servers that stream the in-game viewing get compromised no one can ddos and their ping should be 0ish for all the players / casters

, which // i feel like a lot of the argument against narratology in games criticism as an equally valid approach to games stems from a belief that good art must be accessible to the point of intuitive , without being shallow , which is certainly a valid interpretation of art theory , but i do n't think it is the only one and i do n't think it is enough to steamroll over narratological arguments
