vsplitinf_062	One reason i see this a lot is because i have my ACT set to not end the encounter until nothing happens for 30 seconds, this means that fights with long jumps (shiva's diamond dust, for example) arnt broken into two seperate logs, thus giving me the true encounter dps (I dont care what people say, if the target isnt dead but invulnerable for 15 seconds, that means your dps goes down, not that the invulnerable stage is null and void because the target isnt dead).	1	0
vsplitinf_062	I think the comparison was meant to illustrate a point that when thinking of the greatest inventor and engineer in this world, DaVinci immediately comes to mind with his vast expertise, work and talent in his respective field - when clearly there are other people in history who can claim to at least stand besides him in terms of the achievements in the same field, more or less - since they normally don't get the recognition they deserve or perhaps are overshadowed by more well-known people such as DaVinci.	1	0
