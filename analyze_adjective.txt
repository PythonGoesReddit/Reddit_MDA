so full // my mouth was so full of blind butler and da vinci load , the baby gravy was foaming down my chin and onto my tatas

so many // there 's too much going on , with so many povs you 're getting too much banal detail and i sort of lost track of where the story was headed and it felt like grrm did n't really know either

so please // i speak to this out of experience , so please do n't take it as critical

so worried // i am always so worried about everything and when he doesnt speak to me for a longer time , it drives me crazy

so i // so i guess 1 year isnt enough.i would say ban them for like 5-6 majors

so i // i had no pro team ( i grew up in rural arkansas and unlike most locals , i hate the cowboys ) so i held no affiliations
