This R-Markdown contains a documentation of the linguistic features annotated by our Python script.
Most of the features are taken from Biber (1988), some are adapted from Clarke & Grieve (2017), and some are our own additions. 

For every feature we will first quote how it is defined in the original source (if known) and provide an example. We will then show how the feature is extracted in our code and what the extraction criteria are. If applicable, we will justify any deviations from the original source. We will also provide an accuracy measurement for each feature: an F-score that was calculated from the comparison of the automatic extraction with a manual coding of the feature in question.

Features that were dropped from the analysis can be found at the end of the file.

Note that the Python code included here is not meant to be run on its own. It is copied out of our main script "Reddit_MDA" and serves illustration purposes only.

## Verbs in the past tense: vpast_001

- Definition from Biber: "Any past tense form that occurs in the dictionary, or any word not otherwise identified that is longer than six letters and ends in ed%. Past tense forms have been edited by hand to distinguish between those forms with past participial functions and those with past tense functions." (1988: 223)
- Example from Reddit: San Francisco is in America in case you *forgot* LOL.
- Our search stragey: everything that received the tag "VBD" (verb in the past tense) within the function analyze_verb.
```{python}
    word_tuple = tagged_sentence[index]
    if word_tuple[1] == "VBD":
        features_dict["vpast_001"] += 1
```

## Verbs in the present perfect: vpresperfect_002a

- Definition from Biber: 
  "(a) HAVE + (ADV) + (ADV) + VBN 
  (b) HAVE+ N/PRO + VBN (questions) 
  (includes contracted forms of HAVE)" (1988: 223)
- Example from Reddit: There is no evolution, just a list of animals Chuck Norris *has allowed* to live. 
- Our search strategy: Biber's feature 2 "perfect aspect" does not distinguish between present perfect and past perfect. We therefore decided to split this up into two features (002a and 002b). For the present perfect we count combinations of ["have", "'ve", "has"] plus verbs with the tag "VBN" (past participle of verb) within the function analyze_verb. We are allowing for an unspecified number of intervening adverbs and nouns. 
```{python}
    elif word_tuple[0] in ["have", "'ve", "has"]: 
        move_on = True
        insert_adv = False
        x = index
        while move_on: 
            x += 1
            if tagged_sentence[x][1] == "VBN":
                move_on = False
                features_dict["vpresperfect_002a"] += 1
                if insert_adv:
                    features_dict["vsplitaux_063"] += 1
            elif tagged_sentence[x][1].startswith("R") and tagged_sentence[x][0] not in ["n't", "not"]:
                insert_adv = True
            elif tagged_sentence[x][1].startswith("N") or tagged_sentence[x][1].startswith("P"): 
                move_on = True
            else: 
                move_on = False
```

- Accuracy: 


## Verbs in the past perfect: vpastperfect_002b

- Definition from Biber: 
  "(a) HAVE + (ADV) + (ADV) + VBN 
  (b) HAVE+ N/PRO +VBN (questions) 
  (includes contracted forms of HAVE)" (1988: 223)
- Example from Reddit: I *had* always *thought* they were great idea, [...] 
- Our search strategy: Biber's feature 2 "perfect aspect" does not distinguish between present perfect and past perfect. We therefore decided to split this up into two features (002a and 002b). For the past perfect we count combinations of ["had", "'d"] plus verbs with the tag "VBN" (past participle of verb) within the function analyze_verb. We are allowing for an unspecified number of intervening adverbs and nouns. 
```{python}
    if word_tuple[0] in ["had", "'d"]: 
        move_on = True
        insert_adv = False
        x = index
        while move_on:
            x += 1
            if tagged_sentence[x][1] == "VBN":
                move_on = False
                features_dict["vpastperfect_002b"] += 1
                if insert_adv:
                    features_dict["vsplitaux_063"] += 1
            elif tagged_sentence[x][1].startswith("R") and tagged_sentence[x][0] not in ["n't", "not"]:
                insert_adv = True
            elif tagged_sentence[x][1].startswith("N") or tagged_sentence[x][1].startswith("P"):
                move_on = True 
            else: 
                move_on =  False 
```

## Verbs in the present tense: vpresent_003

- Definition from Biber: "All VB (base form) or VBZ (third person singular present) verb forms in the dictionary, excluding infinitives." (1988: 224)
- Example from Reddit: Dont even *care* about this game anymore. 
- Our search stragey: Within the function analyze_verb we are counting everything with the tag "VBP" (Verb, non-3rd person singular present ) or "VBZ" (Verb, 3rd person singular present ).
```{python}
    elif word_tuple[1] in ["VBP","VBZ"]:
        features_dict["vpresent_003"] += 1
```

- Accuracy: 

## Place adverbials: advplace_004

- Definition from Biber: aboard, above, abroad, across, ahead, alongside, around, ashore, astern, away, behind, below, beneath, beside, downhill, downstairs, downstream, east, far, hereabouts, indoors, inland, inshore, inside, locally, near, nearby, north, nowhere, outdoors, outside, overboard, overland, overseas, south, underfoot, underground, underneath, uphill, upstairs, upstream, west (1988: 224)
- Example from Reddit: *Below* it on the same side is what TCL/BlackBerry are calling a [...]
- Our search stragey: Within the function analyze_adverb we are counting everything that is in our list of place adverbials, "placelist". This list is defined beforehand and contains all the items listed by Biber (no further additions).
```{python}
placelist = ["aboard", "above", "abroad", "across", "ahead", "alongside", "anywhere", "ashore", "astern", "away", "behind", "below", "beneath", "between", "beyond", "beside", "down", "downhill", "downstairs", "downstream", "downwind", "east", "eastward", "eastwards", "elsewhere", "everywhere", "far", "here", "hereabouts", "indoors", "inland", "inshore", "inside", "locally", "near", "nearby", "north", "northward", "northwards", "nowhere", "offshore", "opposite", "outdoors", "outside", "overboard", "overhead", "overland", "overseas", "somewhere", "south", "southward", "southwards", "there", "thereabouts", "through", "throughout", "under", "underfoot", "underground", "underneath", "uphill", "upstairs", "upstream", "west", "westward", "westwards", "within"] 

    elif word_tuple[0] in placelist:
        features_dict["advplace_004"] += 1
```

## Time adverbials on location in time: advtime_position_005a

- Definition from Biber: "afterwards, again, earlier, early, eventually, formerly, immediately, initially, instantly, late, lately, later, momentarily, now, nowadays, once, originally, presently, previously, recently, shortly, simultaneously, soon, subsequently, today, tomorrow, tonight, yesterday" (1988: 224)
- Example from Reddit: *Now* if we're talking about lavo, ovo or lavo-ovo vegetarians, yes, [...]
- Our search strategy: Biber's feature 5, "time adverbials" does not distinguish between adverbials relating to a specific point in time (e.g. "yesterday") and adverbials relating to the frequency of occurrence or duration of an event (e.g. "daily"). We therefore decided to split this feature into two, 005a and 005b. For advtime_position_005a we are looking for items that are in the list "timepoints" within the function analyze_adverb. This list was defined beforehand. 
```{python}
timepoints = ["afterwards", "again", "already", "anymore", "before", "currently", "earlier", "early", "eventually", "formerly", "finally", "immediately", "initially", "instantly", "late", "lately", "later", "momentarily", "now", "nowadays",  "originally", "presently", "previously", "promptly", "recently", "shortly", "simultaneously", "soon", "subsequently", "today", "tomorrow", "tonight", "yesterday"]

    elif word_tuple[0] in timepoints:
        features_dict["advtime_position_005a"] += 1
```

- Accuracy: 

## Time adverbials on frequency: advtime_durfreq_005b

- Definition from Biber: "afterwards, again, earlier, early, eventually, formerly, immediately, initially, instantly, late, lately, later, momentarily, now, nowadays, once, originally, presently, previously, recently, shortly, simultaneously, soon, subsequently, today, tomorrow, tonight, yesterday" (1988: 224)
- Example from Reddit: I think the boxes *usually* ask for oil but you can use the exact same amount in butter.
- Our search strategy: Biber's feature 5, "time adverbials" does not distinguish between adverbials relating to a specific point in time (e.g. "yesterday") and adverbials relating to the frequency of occurrence or duration of an event (e.g. "daily"). We therefore decided to split this feature into two, 005a and 005b. For advtime_durfreq_005b we are looking for items that are in the list "timedurfreq" within the function analyze_adverb. This list was defined beforehand. 
```{python}
timedurfreq = ["always", "annually", "ceaselessly", "commonly", "constantly", "continually", "continuously", "customarily", "daily", "eternally", "evermore", "endlessly", "forever", "fortnightly", "frequently", "habitually", "hourly", "infrequently", "intermittently", "irregularly", "invariably", "monthly", "never", "occasionally", "often", "oftentimes", "once", "periodically", "perpetually", "persistently", "rarely", "repeatedly", "routinely", "seldom", "sometimes", "twice", "unceasingly", "usually","weekly", "yearly"]

    elif word_tuple[0] in timedurfreq:
        features_dict["advtime_durfreq_005b"] += 1
```

- Accuracy: 

## First-person pronouns: profirpers_006

- Definition from Biber: "I, me, we, us, my, our, myself, ourselves (plus contracted forms)" (1988: 225)
- Example from Reddit: Cool, just let *me* know if you change your mind
- Our search strategy: Within the function analyze_pronoun we are looking for everything that is part of the list "firstpersonlist". This list was defined beforehand, it contains the same items as listed in Biber.
```{python}
firstpersonlist = ["i", "me", "we", "us", "my", "our", "myself", "ourselves"]

    elif word_tuple[0] in firstpersonlist:
        features_dict["profirpers_006"] += 1
```

- Accuracy: 

## Second-person pronouns: prosecpers_007

- Definition from Biber: "you, your, yourself, yourselves (plus contracted forms)" (1988: 225)
- Example from Reddit: *You* sound like a smug asshole that likes the smell of his own farts. 
- Our search strategy: Within the function analyze_pronoun we are counting everything that is part of the lsit "secondpersonlist". This list was defined beforehand and contains the same items as mentioned in Biber.
```{python}
secondpersonlist = ["you", "yourself", "your", "yourselves"]

    elif word_tuple[0] in secondpersonlist:
        features_dict["prosecpers_007"] += 1
```

- Accuracy: 

## Third-person pronouns: prothirper_008

- Definition from Biber: "she, he, they, her, him, them, his, their, himself, herself, themselves (plus contracted forms)" (1988: 225)
- Example from Reddit: People who want a cap in *their* ass that's who.
- Our search strategy: Within the function analyze_pronoun we are counting everything that is in the list "thirdpersonlist". This list was defined beforehand and contains the same items as listed in Biber.
```{python}
thirdpersonlist = ["she", "he", "they", "her", "him", "them", "his", "their", "himself","herself", "themselves"]

    elif word_tuple[0] in thirdpersonlist:
        features_dict["prothirdper_008"] += 1
```

- Accuracy: 

## Pronoun 'it': proit_009

- Definition from Biber: not stated, presumably surface form "it" (1988: 225-226)
- Example from Reddit: Not much of a comment, I know, but *it*'s hard to comment on a story that I don't find interesting. 
- Our search strategy: Within the function analyze_pronoun we are counting everything with the surface form "it".
```{python}
    if word_tuple[0] == "it":
        features_dict["proit_009"] += 1
```

- Accuracy:

## Demonstrative pronouns: prodemons_010

- Definition from Biber: 
  "(a) that/this/these/those + V/AUX/CL-P/TS/WHP/W (where that is not a relative pronoun) 
  (b) that's 
  (c) T# + that 
  (that in this last context was edited by hand to distinguish among demonstrative pronouns, relative pronouns, complementizers, etc.)" (1988: 226)
- Example from Reddit: *That*'s not Samuel l Jackson? 
- Our search strategy: We first distinguish between ["this", "these", "those"] and the word "that", since "that" has more potential functions in the sentence. We then check whether the following item (with a potential intervening adjective) is a noun to sort out demonstrative determiners (see feature demonstr_051). All remaining items are counted as demonstrative pronouns. **This is a slight deviation from Biber's approach which we consider necessary since ...** We included this code chunk within the function analyze_pronoun and within analyze_determiner to make sure we catch all cases, irrespective of the POS-tag that was assigned. 
```{python}
    if word_tuple[0] in ["this", "these", "those"]:
        if tagged_sentence[index+1][1].startswith("NN"):
            features_dict["demonstr_051"] += 1
        elif tagged_sentence[index+1][1].startswith("JJ") and tagged_sentence[index+2][1].startswith("NN"):
            features_dict["demonstr_051"] += 1
        else:
            features_dict["prodemons_010"] += 1

    if word_tuple [0] == "that":
        if tagged_sentence[index+1][1].startswith("NN"):
            features_dict["demonstr_051"] += 1
        elif tagged_sentence[index+1][1].startswith("JJ") and tagged_sentence[index+2][1].startswith("NN"):
            features_dict["demonstr_051"] += 1
        elif tagged_sentence[index+1][0] == "X":
            features_dict["prodemons_010"] += 1
        elif tagged_sentence[index+1][1].startswith("JJ"):
            features_dict["prodemons_010"] += 0
        else:
            features_dict["prodemons_010"] += 1
```

- Accuracy:

## Indefinitve pronouns: proindef_011

- Definition from Biber: "anybody, anyone, anything, everybody, everyone, everything, nobody, none, nothing, nowhere, somebody, someone, something" (1988: 226)
- Example from Reddit: I agree, why would *anyone* outside a marketing department create a giant poster with such a bad pun. 
- Our search strategy: We count everything that is in the list "indefpronounlist", which was defined above. The list contains the same items as given by Biber. We included this code within the analyze_noun function and the analyze_pronoun function, because the tagger seemed to be slightly inconsistent in its assignment.
```{python}
indefpronounlist = ["anybody", "anyone", "anything", "everybody", "everyone", "everything", "nobody", "none", "nothing", "nowhere", "somebody", "someone", "something"]

    if word_tuple[0] in indefpronounlist:
        features_dict["proindef_011"] += 1
```

- Accuracy:

## Pro-verb do: pverbdo_012

- Definition from Biber: "DO when NOT in the following constructions: 
  DO + (ADV) + V      (DO as auxiliary) 
  ALL-P/TS/WHP + DO   (DO as question)" (1988: 226)
- Example from Reddit: But when you *do*, he will definitely score for you. 
- Our search strategy: Within the function analyze_verb we are first checking for forms of 'do'. Then we are only counting instances that are in sentence-final position, or that are followed by ["too", "this", "that", "it", "so"] in sentence-final position. **We therefore deviate from Biber's strategy because ...**
```{python}
dolist = ["do", "does", "doing", "did", "done"]

    if word_tuple[0] in dolist:
        if tagged_sentence[index+1][1] == "X" or tagged_sentence[index+1][0] in ALLP:
            features_dict["pverbdo_012"] += 1
        elif tagged_sentence[index+1][0] in ["too", "this", "that", "it", "so"]:
            if tagged_sentence[index+2][1] == "X" or tagged_sentence[index+2][0] in ALLP:
                features_dict["pverbdo_012"] += 1
            else:
                pass
```

- Accuracy:

## WH-questions: whquest_013

- Definition from Biber: "CL-P/Tif + WHO + AUX (where AUX is not part of a contracted form)" (1988: 227)
- Example from Reddit: *WHAT* THE FUCK BARRY 
- Our search strategy: *Within the function analyze_wh_word we are ... We decided to ...*
```{python}
        if word_tuple[1] == "WRB":
            #AB: we initially checked for surface membership in WHO, following Biber (line below). I explain why that's problematic
            #AB: 13. direct WH-questions CL-P/Tif + WHO + AUX (where AUX is not part of a contracted form)
            #AB: The comment above is Biber's definition. It leaves a couple of issues, mainly that "who" as interrogative particle is excluded.
            #AB: We can instead use the tag "WRB" which consistently identifies interrogative particles, including "who" if and only if it is an interrogative particle.
            #AB: We also want to look not only for sentence-initial uses, but for anything following clause-level punctuation. The "SYM" tag should be appropriate.
            if tagged_sentence[index-1][1] in ["X", "SYM"]:  
                if tagged_sentence[index+1][1] == "MD":
                    features_dict["whquest_013"] += 1
            elif tagged_sentence[index+1][1].startswith("V"):
                if tagged_sentence[index+1][0] in belist or tagged_sentence[index+1][0] in havelist or tagged_sentence[index+1][0] in dolist:
                    features_dict["whquest_013"] += 1
                elif word_tuple[0] == "who":
                    features_dict["whquest_013"] += 1
                elif tagged_sentence[index+1] == "the" and tagged_sentence[index+2] in ["hell", "fuck"]:
                    features_dict["whquest_013"] += 1
                elif word_tuple[0] == "what" and tagged_sentence[index+1][0] == "about":
                    features_dict["whquest_013"] += 1
```

- Accuracy:

## Nominalisations: nominalis_014

- Definition from Biber: "All words ending in -tion#, -ment#, -ness#, or -ity# (plus plural forms)" (1988: 227)
- Example from Reddit: Denial that racism exists and how most people discuss it on a public forum could also be considered a mental *illness*.
- Our search strategy: Within the function analyze_noun we are checking for items that end in certain suffixes (same list as given in Biber).
```{python}
    elif word_tuple[0].endswith("tions") or word_tuple[0].endswith("tion") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ments") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ment") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ness") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ity") or word_tuple[0].endswith("nesses") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ities"):
        features_dict["nominalis_014"] += 1
```

- Accuracy:

## Gerunds: gerund_015

- Definition from Biber: "All participle forms serving nominal functions - these are edited by hand." (1988: 227)
- Example from Reddit: Does anyone seriously believe that *closing* the source of the OS will reduce piracy? 
- Our search strategy: Within the function analyze_noun we are looking for items ending in <-ing>. These items are then checked against a list of words that we know not to be gerunds. We are therefore deviating from Biber's procedure since a manual analysis was not feasible.
```{python}
notgerundlist = ["nothing", "everything", "something", "anything", "thing", "things", "ring", "sting", "ting", "viking", "wing", "zing"]

    if word_tuple[0].endswith("ing"):
        if word_tuple[0] not in notgerundlist:
            features_dict["gerund_015"] += 1
```

- Accuracy:

## Nouns: nouns_016

- Definition from Biber: "All nouns included in the dictionary, excluding those forms counted as nominalizations or gerunds." (1988: 228)
- Example from Reddit: Good *lesson*.
- Our search strategy: Within the function analyze_nouns we are counting all items that were not previously identified as gerunds or nominalisations or indefinite pronouns. These are the same criteria as in Biber, except for the indefinite pronouns (which he does not mention).
```{python}
    if word_tuple[0] in indefpronounlist:
        features_dict["proindef_011"] += 1
    if word_tuple[0].endswith("ing"): # or word_tuple[0].endswith("ings"): # removing plural form since gerund nouns only accept sing
        if word_tuple[0] not in notgerundlist:
            features_dict["gerund_015"] += 1
    elif word_tuple[0].endswith("tions") or word_tuple[0].endswith("tion") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ments") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ment") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ness") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ity") or word_tuple[0].endswith("nesses") or word_tuple[0].endswith("ities"):
        features_dict["nominalis_014"] += 1
    else: 
        features_dict["nouns_016"] += 1

- Accuracy:

## Agentless passives: passagentl_017

- Definition from Biber: 
  "(a) BE + (ADV) + (ADV) + VBN 
  (b) BE + N/PRO + VBN  (question form)" (1988: 228)
- Example from Reddit: Your submission *has been* automatically *removed* because you haven't registered with our steam bot to receive flair.
- Our search strategy: Our search strategy here might look rather complex. We are within the function analyze_verb. We first ...
