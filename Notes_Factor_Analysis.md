# (Preliminary) Notes on Factor Analysis
- take one file as input, which contains all comments together with the frequency count for each feature
- run a factor analysis to determine co-occurence of the features
- rotate the factors accordingly (using Promax rotation?)
- calculate dimension scores for each comment based on the factor solution
- save each comment together with the dimension scores to a new file
