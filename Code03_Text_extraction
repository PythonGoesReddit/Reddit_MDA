## this code should:
## - take monthly sets of Reddit comments in JSON format as input
## - go through each line and select the actual text only (disregard all the metadata)
## - save all the text (one comment per line) to a separate (monthly) txt-file which can then be used as input for the Biber-tagger

## maybe we should have two versions of this code? One that saves one comment per line and one that saves one sentence per line?
